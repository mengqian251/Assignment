All three also serve as head writers. The show premiered on CBS on September 24 2007.[3] The series' tenth season premiered on September 19 2016.[4] In March 2017 the series was renewed for two additional seasons bringing its total to twelve and running through the 2018–19 television season. The eleventh season premiered on September 25 2017.[5] The show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena California: Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper both physicists at Caltech who share an apartment; Penny a waitress and aspiring actress who later becomes a pharmaceutical representative and who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's similarly geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four men are contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.[6][7] Over time supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle a physicist who dated Leonard and Howard; neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website (and later becomes Sheldon's girlfriend); Bernadette Rostenkowski Howard's wife (previously his girlfriend) a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; Stuart Bloom the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit; and Emily Sweeney a dermatologist who dated Raj.

The only characters retained in both pilots were Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons) who are named after Sheldon Leonard a longtime figure in episodic television as producer director and actor. Althea (Vernee Watson) was a character featured in both pilots and the first series episode.[8] Two female leads were Canadian actress Amanda Walsh as Katie "a street-hardened tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior "[9][10] and Iris Bahr as Gilda a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters. Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used Thomas Dolby's hit "She Blinded Me with Science" as its theme song. Although the show was not picked up its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny (Kaley Cuoco). The original unaired pilot never has officially been released but it has circulated on the Internet. On the evolution of the show Chuck Lorre said "We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal." As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future DVD release Lorre said "Wow that would be something. We will see. Show your failures..."[11] The first and second pilots of The Big Bang Theory were directed by James Burrows who did not continue with the show. The reworked second pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14 2007.[12] Prior to its airing on CBS the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered on September 24 2007 and was picked up for a full 22-episode season on October 19 2007.[13] The show is filmed in front of a live audience [14] and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.[15] Production was halted on November 6 2007 due to the Writers Guild of America strike. Nearly three months later on February 4 2008 the series was temporarily replaced by a short-lived sitcom Welcome to the Captain. The series returned on March 17 2008 in an earlier time slot[16] and ultimately only 17 episodes were produced for the first season.[17][18] After the strike ended the show was picked up for a second season airing in the 2008–2009 season premiering in the same time slot on September 22 2008.[19] With increasing ratings the show received a two-year renewal through the 2010–11 season in 2009.[20][21] In 2011 the show was picked up for three more seasons.[22] In March 2014 the show was renewed again for three more years through the 2016–17 season. This marks the second time the series has gained a three-year renewal.[23] In March 2017 the series was renewed for two additional seasons bringing its total to 12 and running through the 2018–19 television season.[24] David Saltzberg a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California Los Angeles checks scripts and provides dialogue mathematics equations and diagrams used as props.[6] According to executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady "We're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... . We worked hard to get all the science right."[7] Several of the actors in The Big Bang Theory previously worked together on the sitcom Roseanne including Johnny Galecki Sara Gilbert Laurie Metcalf (who plays Sheldon's mother Mary Cooper) and Meagen Fay (who plays Bernadette's mother). Additionally Lorre was a writer on the series for several seasons. Theme song Single cover for "Big Bang Theory Theme" by Barenaked Ladies (2007) The Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the show's theme song which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer Ed Robertson was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence Robertson had recently read Simon Singh's book Big Bang [25][26] and at the concert improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.[citation needed] Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows but ending up being rejected because of producer's favor of other artist's song Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.[citation needed] On October 9 2007 a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially.[27] Although some sources identify the song title as "History of Everything "[28] the cover art for the single identifies the title as "Big Bang Theory Theme." A music video also was released via special features on The Complete Fourth Season DVD and Blu-ray set.[29][30] The theme was included on the band's greatest hits album Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before released on September 27 2011.[31] In September 2015 TMZ uncovered court documents showing that Steven Page sued former bandmate Robertson over the song alleging that he was promised 20% of the proceeds but that Robertson has kept that money entirely for himself.[32] Actors' salaries For the first three seasons Galecki Parsons and Cuoco the three main stars of the show received at most $60 000 per episode. The salary for the three went up to $200 000 per episode for the fourth season. Their per-episode pay went up an additional $50 000 in each of the following three seasons culminating in $350 000 per episode in the seventh season.[33][34] In September 2013 Bialik and Rauch renegotiated the contracts they held since they were introduced to the series in 2010. On their old contracts each was making $20 000–$30 000 per episode while the new contracts doubled that beginning at $60 000 per episode increasing steadily to $100 000 per episode by the end of the contract as well as adding another year for both.[35] By season seven Galecki Parsons and Cuoco were also receiving 0.25% of the series' back-end money. Before production began on the eighth season the three plus Helberg and Nayyar looked to renegotiate new contracts with Galecki Parsons and Cuoco seeking around $1 million per episode as well as more back-end money.[36] Contracts were signed in the beginning of August 2014 giving the three principal actors an estimated $1 million per episode for three years with the possibility to extend for a fourth year. The deals also include larger pieces of the show signing bonuses production deals and advances towards the back-end.[37] Helberg and Nayyar were also able to renegotiate their contracts giving them a per-episode pay in the "mid-six-figure range" up from around $100 000 per episode they each received in years prior. The duo who were looking to have salary parity with Parsons Galecki and Cuoco signed their contracts after the studio and producers threatened to write the characters out of the series if a deal could not be reached before the start of production on season eight.[38] By season 10 Helberg and Nayyar reached the $1 million per episode parity with Parsons Galecki and Cuoco due to a clause in their deals signed in 2014.[39] In March 2017 the main cast members (Galecki Parsons Cuoco Helberg and Nayyar) took a 10% pay cut to allow Bialik and Rauch an increase in their earnings.[40] This put Galecki Parsons Cuoco Helberg and Nayyar at $900 000 per episode with Parsons Galecki and Helberg also receiving overall deals with Warner Bros. Television.[24] By the end of April Bialik and Rauch had signed deals to earn $500 000 per episode each with the deals also including a separate development component for both actors. The deal was an increase from the $175 000 – $200 000 the duo had been making per episode.[41] Cast and characters This section describes a work or element of fiction in a primarily in-universe style.

The four main male characters are employed at Caltech and have science-related occupations as do Bernadette and Amy. The characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news (notably around the start of the show) and make science-related jokes. Science has also interfered with the characters' romantic lives. Leslie breaks up with Leonard when he sides with Sheldon in his support for string theory rather than loop quantum gravity.[69] When Leonard joins Sheldon Raj and Howard on a three-month Arctic research trip it separates Leonard and Penny at a time their relationship is budding. When Bernadette takes an interest in Leonard's work it makes both Penny and Howard envious and results in Howard confronting Leonard and Penny asking Sheldon to teach her physics.[70] Sheldon and Amy also briefly end their relationship after an argument over which of their fields is superior.[71] David Saltzberg who has a PhD in physics has served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and attends every taping.[72] While Saltzberg knows physics he sometimes needs assistance from Mayim Bialik who has a PhD in neuroscience.[73] Saltzberg sees early versions of scripts which need scientific information added to them and he also points out where the writers despite their knowledge of science have made a mistake. He is usually not needed during a taping unless a lot of science and especially the whiteboard is involved.[73] Science fiction media Star Trek: The Next Generation actor Wil Wheaton has a recurring role as a fictional version of himself on the show. The four main male characters are all avid science fiction fantasy and comic book fans and memorabilia collectors. Star Trek in particular is frequently referenced and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of Spock so much so that when he is given a used napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy as a Christmas gift from Penny he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude ("I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!").[74] Star Trek: The Original Series cast member George Takei has made a cameo and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage Mr. Spock action figure (both cameos were in dream sequences). Star Trek: The Next Generation cast members Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton have had cameos as themselves [75][76] while Wil Wheaton has a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself. They are also fans of Star Wars Battlestar Galactica and Doctor Who. In the episode "The Ornithophobia Diffusion" when there is a delay in watching Star Wars on Blu-ray Howard complains "If we don't start soon George Lucas is going to change it again" (referring to Lucas' controversial alterations to the films) and in "The Hot Troll Deviation" Katee Sackhoff of Battlestar Galactica appeared as Howard's fantasy dream girl. The characters have different tastes in franchises with Sheldon praising Firefly but disapproving of Leonard's enjoyment of Babylon 5.[77][n 1] With regard to fantasy the four make frequent references to The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter novels and movies. Additionally Howard can speak Sindarin one of the two Elvish languages from The Lord of the Rings. Wednesday night is the group's designated "comic book night"[78] because that is the day of the week when new comic books are released. The comic book store is run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart. On a number of occasions the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters including The Flash Aquaman Frodo Baggins Superman Batman Spock The Doctor Green Lantern and Thor.[79] As a consequence of losing a bet to Stuart and Wil Wheaton the group members are forced to visit the comic book store dressed as Catwoman Wonder Woman Batgirl and Supergirl.[80] DC Comics announced that to promote its comics the company will sponsor Sheldon wearing Green Lantern T-shirts.[81] Various games have been featured as well as referenced on the series (e.g. World of Warcraft Halo Mario etc.) including fictional games like Mystic Warlords of Ka'a (which became a reality in 2011)[82] and Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Leonard and Penny's relationship One of the recurring plot lines is the relationship between Leonard and Penny. Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Their first long term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the North Pole in the season 3 premiere. However when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in "The Good Guy Fluctuation". Penny who admits to missing Leonard in "The Roommate Transmogrification" accepts his request to renew their relationship in "The Beta Test Initiation". After Penny suggests having sex in "The Launch Acceleration" Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says "no" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in "The Tangible Affection Proof". In the sixth-season episode "The 43 Peculiarity" Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in "The Bon Voyage Reaction". After Leonard returns their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode "The Gorilla Dissolution" Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale but beforehand wanting no secrets Leonard admits to kissing another woman Mandy Chow (Melissa Tang) while on an expedition on the North Sea. Despite this Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere. Sheldon and Amy's relationship In the third-season finale Raj and Howard search for a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In "The Agreement Dissection" Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed Sheldon says "fascinating" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in "The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition". The same night he draws up "The Relationship Agreement" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his "Roommate Agreement" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it. In the episode "The Launch Acceleration" Amy tries to use her "neurobiology bag of tricks" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. In the final fifth-season episode "The Countdown Reflection" Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode "The Date Night Variable" after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In "The Cooper/Kripke Inversion" Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that "it's a possibility" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in "The Love Spell Potential". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.[83] "The Locomotive Manipulation" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However in the season finale Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However in "The Prom Equivalency" he hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack. In the season eight finale Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their 5-year anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday. Howard's mother In scenes set at Howard's home he interacts with his rarely-seen mother (voiced by Carol Ann Susi until her death) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts with other characters in this manner.[84] She reflects the Jewish mother stereotype in some ways such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on Howard as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning. Howard in turn is attached to his mother to the point where she still cuts his meat for him takes him to the dentist does his laundry and "grounds" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.[85] Until Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale Howard's former living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may suffer from some type of pathology [86] and Sheldon to refer to their relationship as Oedipal.[87] In season 8 Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida which devastates Howard and Stuart who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz. Vanity cards Like most shows created by Chuck Lorre The Big Bang Theory ends by showing a vanity card written by Lorre after the credits followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These cards are archived on Lorre's website.[88] The Theorists Through the use of his vanity cards at the end of episodes Lorre alleged that the program had been plagiarized by a show produced and aired in Belarus. Officially titled Теоретики (The Theorists) the show features "clones" of the main characters a similar opening sequence and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.[89] Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Bros. legal department about options. The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.[90] However no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as it became known that the show was unlicensed the actors quit and the producers cancelled it.[91] Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart "Seva") said in an interview "I'm upset. At first the actors were told all legal issues were resolved. We didn't know it wasn't the case so when the creators of The Big Bang Theory started talking about the show I was embarrassed. I can't understand why our people first do and then think. I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career. And I don't want to take part in a stolen show".[92] Reception Critical reception Initial reception for the series was mixed. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 55% approval rating for the first season based on reviews from 22 critics with an average rating of 5.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads "The Big Bang Theory brings a new class of character to mainstream television but much of the comedy feels formulaic and stiff."[93] On Metacritic the season holds a score of 57 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics indicating "mixed or average reviews".[94] Later seasons received more acclaim and in 2013 TV Guide ranked the series #52 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.[95] U.S. standard ratings The Big Bang Theory started off slowly in the ratings failing to make the top 50 in its first season (ranking 68th) and ranking 40th in its second season. When the third season premiered on September 21 2009 however The Big Bang Theory ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18–49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83 million viewers.[96] After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday nights CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the 2010–2011 schedule to be in direct competition with NBC's Comedy Block and Fox's American Idol (then the longest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to 2011).[97] During its fourth season it became television's highest rated comedy just barely beating out eight-year champ Two and a Half Men. However in the age 18–49 demographic (the show's target age range) it was the second highest rated comedy behind ABC's Modern Family. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.[98] The sixth season boasts some of the highest-rated episodes for the show so far with a then-new series high set with "The Bakersfield Expedition" with 20 million viewers [99] a first for the series which along with NCIS made CBS the first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in the same week since 2007. In the sixth season the show became the highest rated and viewed scripted show in the 18–49 demographic trailing only the live regular NBC Sunday Night Football coverage [100][101] and was third in total viewers trailing NCIS and Sunday Night Football.[102] Season seven of the series opened strong continuing the success gained in season six with the second episode of the premiere "The Deception Verification" setting the new series high in viewers with 20.44 million.[103][104] Showrunner Steve Molaro who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in off-network syndication particularly on TBS while Michael Schneider of TV Guide attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the influence of Molaro in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships such as the on-again off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.[105] Throughout much of the 2012–13 season The Big Bang Theory placed first in all of syndication ratings receiving formidable competition from only Judge Judy and Wheel of Fortune (first-run syndication programs). By the end of the 2012–13 television season The Big Bang Theory had dethroned Judge Judy as the ratings leader in all of syndicated programming with 7.1 Judy descending to second place for that season with a 7.0.[106] The Big Bang Theory did not place first in syndication ratings for the 2013–14 television season beaten out by Judge Judy.[107] Season Timeslot (ET) Episodes First aired Last aired TV season Rank Avg. viewers (millions) Date Viewers (millions) Date Viewers (millions) 1 Monday 8:30pm (1–8) Monday 8:00pm (9–17) 17 September 24  2007 (2007-09-24) 9.52[108] May 19  2008 (2008-05-19) 7.34[109] 2007–08 68 8.31[110] 2 Monday 8:00pm (1–14 16–23) Monday 9:30pm (15)[111] 23 September 22  2008 (2008-09-22) 9.36[112] May 11  2009 (2009-05-11) 9.81[113] 2008–09 40 10.03[114] 3 Monday 9:30pm (1–19 21–23) Monday 9:00pm (20)[111] 23 September 21  2009 (2009-09-21) 12.96[115] May 24  2010 (2010-05-24) 14.78[116] 2009–10 12 14.22[117] 4 Thursday 8:00pm 24 September 23  2010 (2010-09-23) 14.04[118] May 19  2011 (2011-05-19) 11.30[119] 2010–11 13 13.21[120] 5 24 September 22  2011 (2011-09-22) 14.30[121] May 10  2012 (2012-05-10) 13.72[122] 2011–12 8 15.82[123] 6 24 September 27  2012 (2012-09-27) 15.66[124] May 16  2013 (2013-05-16) 15.48[125] 2012–13 3 18.68[126] 7 24 September 26  2013 (2013-09-26) 18.99[127] May 15  2014 (2014-05-15) 16.73[128] 2013–14 2 19.96[129] 8 Monday 8:00pm (1–6) Thursday 8:00pm (7–24) 24 September 22  2014 (2014-09-22) 18.08[130] May 7  2015 (2015-05-07) 14.64[131] 2014–15 2 19.05[132] 9 24 September 21  2015 (2015-09-21) 18.20[133] May 12  2016 (2016-05-12) 14.73[134] 2015–16 2 20.36[67] 10 Monday 8:00pm (1–5) Thursday 8:00pm (6–24) 24 September 19  2016 (2016-09-19) 15.82[135] May 11  2017 (2017-05-11) 12.99[136] 2016–17 2 18.99[137] 11 Monday 8:00pm (1–) TBA September 25  2017 (2017-09-25) 17.65[138] TBA TBD 2017–18 TBD TBD UK distribution and ratings The show made its United Kingdom debut on Channel 4 on February 14 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4 prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season all episodes were shown first-run on E4 with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity usually on a weekend morning. From the third season the show aired in two parts being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17 2009 at 9:00 p.m. while the second part containing the remaining eleven episodes began airing in the same time period from May 6 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4 2010 at 9:00 p.m. drawing 877 000 viewers with a further 256 000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers making it E4's most watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.[139] The fourth season's second half began on June 30 2011. Season 5 began airing on November 3 2011 at 8:00 p.m. as part of E4's Comedy Thursdays acting as a lead-in to the channel's newest comedy Perfect Couples. Episode 19 the highest-viewed episode of the season attracted 1.4 million viewers.[140] Season 6 premiered on November 15 2012 with 1.89 million viewers and a further 469 000 on the time shift channel bringing the total to 2.31 million E4's highest viewing ratings of 2012 and the highest the channel had received since June 2011. The sixth season returned in mid 2013 to finish airing the remaining episodes.[141] Season 7 premiered on E4 on October 31 2013 at 8:30pm and hit multiple ratings records this season. The second half of season seven aired in mid 2014.[142] The eighth season premiered on E4 on October 23 2014 at 8:30 p.m.[143] During its eighth season The Big Bang Theory shared its 8:30 p.m. time period with fellow CBS comedy 2 Broke Girls. Following the airing of the first eight episodes of that show's fourth season The Big Bang Theory returned to finish airing its eighth season on March 19 2015.[144] Netflix UK & Ireland announced on February 13 2016 that seasons 1–8 would be available to stream from February 15 2016.[145] Canadian ratings The Big Bang Theory started off quietly in Canada but managed to garner major success in later seasons.
